            "Full text: Hello and welcome to the commentary. For the hitch introduction. Get started. Pictures of great movie by the way it sits really nice movie it's a romantic comedy itsfunneh starring will smith. And. I have used hit. Many times in my classes. In san francisco. I will use the whole movie not just one scene but i will. Teach the entire movie. Little by little. And what i do it's called the focal skills movie technique. But it sounds great but but. It's really quite simple. I show one scene of a movie. 82 minutes. Maybe one minute. And i show it at normal speed then i go back. Then i show it again and i pause and i explain new vocabulary slang and idioms. And i go back again. Then i this the third time i turn the sound off. And then i played part of the scene i pause and i asked the students questions about the movie. I might say. You know what's happening here describe this character. What do you think he is thinking. I why is he doing this. What is this person doing. Describe the place where they are at. What are they saying to each other. Anyway i asked a lot of. About. What's happening in the movie. Then after we finish that three times i go to the next scene. And we do the same thing again. The one movie usually takes a few weeks to to show. But. It's works really well is very very popular my student love it. It's the most most popular thing i do in my class. And so i started thinking again this is really popular students love it. How can i do this on effortless english is more difficult i can't. Show you the movie. On effortless english. But i thought maybe i could record. Scenes from the movie the audio. And then i could use that. For the basic lesson. And then i could make vocabulary. Lessons and mini story lesson. To help you understand that movie scene. So that's why this this hitch introduction it's my first try my first experiment. To see if i can start using movies. Steve kaufmann the linguist. And i i think we disagree about movies. He doesn't like movies he's he thinks movies are not very good for learning language. He thinks they're not intensive enough and i understand his point. There's a lot more language. Concentrated. In a book. An audiobook. An audio article. However. I disagree i think they're fantastic ways to learn language. Fantastic sources. Because. Thing i like about movies number one. Movies use more natural. Conversational english. Books even even authentic real native speaker articles or books. They use a writing style of english. It's a little bit more formal. Then what we actually use when we speak. Because when we speak. We use a lot more idioms. We use a lot more slang. We use words like ain't. Ghana. Moana. All those kind of things we use every single day. If you listen to two americans. Talking to each other. They do not sound like written english you know it. Different kind of english. If it's not better or worse but it is a little bit different movies are closer to that kind of english. The kind of english you here on the street if you walk around san francisco. People speak more like you hear in the movies. Not. So much like you here. Orsi's in books. So i think movies are out and great way to learn real conversational english. Casual english. And. Especially americans are quite casual when we speak. We usually are casual. Even if i speak to my boss i'm not formal. I'm very casual when i speak to my boss. The teachers. When i speak to my parents i'm very casual. So i like movies for that reason. Another reason i like movies. Movies have a continuous story. So you can understand the vocabulary and the phrases in the slang. If there's a big context. You understand the whole situation. And especially when you can see it. You understand more. How the vocabulary is used. In what situations the vocabularies use. And end. A third reason i think. Movies are great for memory. Because. You not only hear the language but you have a picture. To connect. With the language. So if you hear the line. Any man can sweep any woman off her feet. Sweep off her feet. Well you could memorize that phrase and you can read it in an article that's okay but if you see the movie hitch. You will you will have some images you'll have some pictures from the movie. To connect with that phrase. And it will help you remember the phrase. Much much much. More easily. So for all of those reasons i think movies actually are very powerful ways to learn languages. If you use them correctly. Just watching a movie. Full speed. One time. It's not good it's not efficient steve is right. It's not a good way. Took to use movies correctly you really need to watch it scene by scene. You need to repeat. The scenes many times now at if you don't have a teacher to help you. Like my class. I can help. I can do it. But if you're on your own you're at your home you're doing this yourself here's what you can do buy a dvd or rent a dvd what's a hitch i recommend. Do it with hitch. You put it in. And maybe watch it one time to get the general idea but to study with it to learn with it. You go back and you do what i do in my class you play one scene you use english subtitles. And you play the scene one time. Trying to get the general idea. Then you go back you pause after one minute or two minutes. You go back to the beginning of the scene. Play it again this time. Every time you don't understand a word or phrase you pause. You write it down in your little notebook or something and you use your dictionary. And you find out what wow what does this word mean what does this word mean. If it's an idiom. Or slang you might need to get on the internet. There are go to google and type in english idioms. You can there many different websites that you can find some of those idioms some of that slang you can find it on the internet the meaning. So you go through the same. Little by little write step-by-step finding all the new words and phrases in slang an idiom. That you can find. If you can't find something just don't worry about it just forget it keep going. Just get as much as you can. After that. Go back again watch the scene one more time this time you should understand more. And go to the next scene. Repeat the same process. It will take you some time to go through all of the movie. But the good thing is you will be learning real conversational english. As native speakers use it. On the street. In real conversation. You won't be learning. The textbook english. That nobody uses. You won't be using. Or learning. More formal english. Which people do use but. Maybe not as much. You'll be using average. Everyday converse. English. That's good. So that's that that's one great way to use movies one reason i love. Movies. You think. And i think that's why they're very popular with my students. My students often complain. Wow i know all the textbook english i understand all this grammar we did. You know i studied all my all these years. And i can read articles i can read toefl articles. And understand them. But i go to the bus stop. Two americans are talking to each other. I can't understand them i don't know what they're saying. Because they're using casual english they're using a lot of idioms are using slang they're speaking quickly. All those reasons. They're not speaking the way the textbook. Stop. That's my sales pitch. Use movies. Now for hitch. If you like this if you like me using this movie did you like this lesson. Please tell me go to the forums and write a comment. You're just tell me aj please use more movies. If you tell me that if members tell me they want movies i will do this. More maybe i'll do the next scene in hitch. Maybe i'll go through most of hitch. Scene by scene and do lessons for each party. And eventually you could do the whole movie this way. So if you like that idea please tell me if you don't if no one tells me i might not do it. Cuz i did a lot of work. I want to make sure. That you like that. But. One important part of this is that you need the pictures right. Just listening to the audio is okay but you really should watch the movie at least one time. So2. Get the most power. From this lesson please go rent the movie hitch. Hey. The movie name is kitsch. The star is will smith the actor. Rent the movie at least one time then when you hear the audio. From effortless english you can remember some of the pictures you can remember what's happening in the story because you saw the movie. It's very important to go get this movie and watch it. It will be much better than just listening to effortless english only. If you watch it first. Then the lessons will be more powerful for you. Okay finally i have one more suggestion for you for using movies. And that is. Movies are great for pronunciation work. For improving your pronunciation. In fact when i with my private students. I use movies all the time. To help them with pronunciation. In fact i use this speech at the beginning of hitch i've used it many many many times. The reason is this. One as i said already. Movies use conversational english. Usually. And on the movie but usually. And number two. Often or usually the actors have very good pronunciation. A movie like hitch with will smith movie like about a boy. With you grant. They have excellent pronunciation. Right there professional they get paid a lot of money. To speak well. Speak powerfully. To have really clear. Strong. English speech. So they're good people to imitate. Imitate julia roberts imitate will smith imitates hugh grant if your pronunciation is like there is he will soundgear fans. So i like using these movie scenes for pronunciation. Here's what you do. Use the audio from this lesson. Hitch intro audio the mp3. The original from the movie. And first listen to it many times you know over you know 1 week 2 weeks listen to it until you understand it easily. Then. Start. Pausing after every sentence. Pause. \n"
